## Running the Toolbox
The toolbox may be used in Python or MATLAB. In either case, you will need to install Python along with required libraries.

To install the requirements, run the following in Python 3,

```
$ pip -r install requirements.txt
```

This can be done globally or using a virtual environment - e.g. [see here](https://dev.to/emminex/how-to-install-python-libraries-in-visual-studio-code-38i1).

## Contributions
To contribute, please run the tutorial files `tests.py` and `tests.m` to make sure that the changes do not break the code before submitting a pull request. Future releases may include testing scripts.
