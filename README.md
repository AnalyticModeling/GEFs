## Capabilities for Filter Design and Filtering

### Constructing Arbitrary Filters, Filterbanks, and Multiband Filters
* Arbitrary filters may be constructed - e.g. using provided poles and zeros, then used for filtering any signal.

### Filtering
* A signal provided as a time-series or a frequency response may be inputted into a constructed or designed filter, filterbank, or multiband filter.
* The output signal may be generated by filtering the input signal using any of several solution methods with some specific to GEFs/GAFs and others that apply more generally.

### Signal Analysis and Plots
* The toolbox includes functionalities for any signal such as autocorrelation and envelope extraction.
* Filterbanks with constitutive filters - each with a different peak frequency, may be used to generate outputs. Plots include the envelope of the output signals as a function of time and peak frequency.

### Characteristics-Based Design of Classes of Bandpass Filters (e.g. GEFs)
* Designs certain classes of bandpass filters such as Generalized Exponent Filters (GEFs) also known as Generalized Auditory Filters (GAFs) based on simultaneous specifications on filter characteristics including peak frequencies, quality factors, and group delays. This is as opposed to filter design based on the complex frequency response or its magnitudes or amplitude over a length of frequencies.
* The characteristics-based design method is direct, non-iterartive, highly-accurate for sharp filters, and allows for designing sharp filters with minimal delay.
* The characteristics-based design methods extends beyond GEFs to related bandpass filters (see [3]) as well as to filterbanks and bandpass filters and may be used for adaptive filtering based on variable filter design.
* The accuracy in achieving the desired specifications on filter characteristics is assessed.

### Designing and Filtering with Rational Exponent Filters (Rational GEFs)
* In order to access a continuum of filter characteristics, GEFs may have rational exponents rather than being constraint to discrete filter behavior.
* The toolbox includes various solution methods for filtering using rational GEFs.

### Potential Signal Processing Applications for GEFs
* Potential applications may benefit from the direct specification over desired characteristics as well as the fine control over the characteristics enabled by the rational exponents.  may include: parameteric equalizers [3] XXX

### Filters Related to GEFs
* Filters related to GEFs include the gammatone family of filters - e.g. Gammatone Filters (GTFs), All-Pole Gammatone Filters (APGFs), One-zero Gammatone Filters (OZGFs) [5]

## Highlights for GEFs and Rational GEFs
* Allows for designing filters, filterbanks, and multiband filters by directly dictating or controling specifications on desired filter characteristics such as peak frequencies, quality factors and group delays.
* Enables accessing a continuum of behavior not classically achievable with integer-exponent or integer-order filters.
* Enables solving and filtering with rational-exponent filters

## Tutorials and Documentation
* Documentation for the toolbox is in `documentation.pdf`. Example plots in the documentation are generated in python using `tutorial.py`. These illustrate a comprehensive set of the toolbox's capabilities.
* `alkhairy2019.m` generates some of the figures in [1] and [2] are are of the greatest interest to those in auditory physics and modeling cochlear mechanisms.
* `alkhairy2024.m` generates some of the figures in [3] and [4] and are of the greatest interest to those in signal processing and filter design.  


## Requirements for Running the Toolbox
The toolbox may be used in Python or MATLAB. In either case, you will need to install Python along with required libraries which are listed in `requirements.txt`.

To install the requirements, run the following in Python 3,

```
$ pip -r install requirements.txt
```

This can be done globally or using a virtual environment - e.g. [see here](https://dev.to/emminex/how-to-install-python-libraries-in-visual-studio-code-38i1).

## Contributing
Before submitting a pull request, please run the tutorial files `tutorial.py`, `alkhairy2019.m`, and `alkhairy2024.m` to make sure that the changes do not break the code. Future releases may include dedicated testing scripts.
