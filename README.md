## Tutorials and Documentation
* Documentation for the toolbox is in `documentation.pdf`. Example plots in the documentation are generated in python using `tutorial.py`. These illustrate a comprehensive set of the toolbox's capabilities.
* `alkhairy2019.m` generates some of the figures in [1] and [2] are are of the greatest interest to those in auditory physics and modeling cochlear mechanisms.
* `alkhairy2024.m` generates some of the figures in [3] and [4] and are of the greatest interest to those in signal processing and filter design.  


## Requirements for Running the Toolbox
The toolbox may be used in Python or MATLAB. In either case, you will need to install Python along with required libraries.

To install the requirements, run the following in Python 3,

```
$ pip -r install requirements.txt
```

This can be done globally or using a virtual environment - e.g. [see here](https://dev.to/emminex/how-to-install-python-libraries-in-visual-studio-code-38i1).

## Contributing
To contribute, please run the tutorial files `tutorial.py`, `alkhairy2019.m`, and `alkhairy2024.m` to make sure that the changes do not break the code before submitting a pull request. Future releases may include dedicated testing scripts.
